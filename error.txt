* not giving dependency array in useEffect made infinite call

* You're still getting infinite API calls because you're using the state variables as dependencies in your useEffect hooks like this:

* replace avoids adding the bad URL to the browser history (i.e., user wonâ€™t hit the back button and return to the invalid path).

* The issue is happening because your entire RecipeCard has an onClick event on the parent <div> that navigates to the recipe page, 
including when you click on the "love" span inside it.
âœ… Fix: Prevent event bubbling using event.stopPropagation()

Wrap the onClick of "love" with e => { e.stopPropagation(); ... } so it doesn't trigger the parent click.
