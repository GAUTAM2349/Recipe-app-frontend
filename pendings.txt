* What is a Preflight Request?

When a web application (e.g. running on localhost:3000) tries to send a non-simple HTTP request to a different origin (e.g. api.myserver.com), the browser first sends a preflight request using the OPTIONS method to the target server before the actual request.
A preflight request checks:

    Is the requested HTTP method (e.g. POST, PUT, DELETE) allowed?

    Are the custom headers being sent allowed?

    Can this origin access the resource?
